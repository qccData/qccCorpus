# qccCorpus

Repository for the Quechua Collao corpus baselines for automatic dimensional emotion recognition:
-   Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
-   K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNR)
-   Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
-   Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
-   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
-   Long short-term Memory (LSTM)

Run each file to reproduce results. Note that Tensorflow 1 is needed to run MLP, CNN, and LSTM.
